⚡ A fully automated, start to end, multiplatform process using the real-time* real-data from The World Bank Group, including data extraction, transformation, storing in relational databases, querying and visualizing in beautiful interactive dashboards!

🐍 Wrote a Python script for data extraction through an API or csv files, then transforming the data and get it ready for exporting, finally connecting to the SQL database and inserting the data; using libraries such as Pandas and NumPy. The script can be ran whenever new data is available.​

🛢️ Constructed a relational database in both MySQL and MSSQLServer, designed in MySQL Workbench, composed of tables, foreign keys, stored procedures and more.

🔎 Wrote several SQL queries compatible with both platforms for a fast and precise retrieval of useful information and to check that the dashboards' data is accurate.

​📊 Created 3 beautiful interactive dashboards in 3 different platforms: Tableau, Power BI and Excel.​ Retrieving data from the SQL database and displaying it with useful charts into 3 dashboards: Loans, Countries and Details; now with a dark mode toggle!

*real-time has been disabled since there is no maintenance for this project.
